# Anime-recommendation

Onichiwa!

This is an anime recommendation System



Problem statement:
Every streaming content has its own viewers and each content has it's rating. Viewers leave some good ratings for the content if they like it. But where does it apply? Viewers can spend hours scrolling through hundreds, sometimes thousands of anime's never finding an content they like. Business need to be provided suggestions based on their likes and needs in order to create a better streaming environment that boosts revenue and increases the time spent on a website.
